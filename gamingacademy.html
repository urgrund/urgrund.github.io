      <h3 class="left">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="left"> The Gaming Academy was an initiative of twofour54 to stimulate talent growth in the creative
        industries, in particular video
        games.

        The course initally started in 2011 though I took over from 2012 and ran the course from both an
        administrative and content delivery perspective and managed stakeholder interest as <b>Head of Academy</b>.
        After my departure in 2015 the academy wrapped up, though I have kept in contact
        with students and it has been exciting to watch their journey into the video games industry!

      <h4 class="left">Creation of Curriculum</h4>
      <p>
        Initially, the curriculum for the course had been constructed from a handful of discrete units in order kick
        start the academy. Whilst these
        units gave some academic/theoretical grounding in game design, they weren't suited for either the timeframe of
        the course nor the desired practical, hands-on skills that employers generally seek in graduate developers -
        this coming from
        direct experience both hiring and applying!
        <br />
        <br />
        From this, the curriculum had a rewrite that would focus on a careful introduction of topics that considered
        any foundational and technical prerequisites along with a sober outlook as to just how far, in general, students
        could go with a particular subject over the course of 18 months. The units were designed to be complimentary and
        therefore were logically placed over the trimesters.
        <br />
        <br />
        The curriculum was also designed in a way that individual units, or logical groups, could be delivered
        independtly as short-courses. This modularity would help keep the Gaming Academy flexible and relevant whilst
        opening up other revenue streams using the same content.
      </p>


      <h4 class="left">Outreach</h4>
      <p>
        - Creating awareness for the Gaming Academy
        - Visits to local Universities, discussing game development as a career and the oppotunities in the UAE
        - Marketing efforts through Youtube, radio and magazines.

        "Curse of Mermos is a free, lighthearted hack and slash game with fast paced action and challenging combat.
        Players wield the Hammer of Horus or shoot the Crossbow of Neith to defeat hordes of monsters in the tomb of
        Ebo. The game features unlock-able abilities and skill upgrades for personalized combat."

      <p>This was the students final project where everyone worked together for 4 months creating a fun and
        fast paced hack 'n slash title. Curse of Mermos was <a
          href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/352160/">successfully
          released on Steam</a>, the biggest digital games distribution platforms and has enjoyed more than 70'000
        downloads.

        The success of this title is a great example of how the Gaming Academy was structured and delivered to prepare
        students for real-world production scenarios.

        I assissted in the production aspects of the project and practiced common industry methods for development
        transforming the classroom environment into a production studio simulation.
