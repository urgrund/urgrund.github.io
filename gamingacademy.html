      <h3 class="left">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="left"> The Gaming Academy was an initiative of twofour54 to stimulate talent growth in the creative
        industries, in particular video
        games.

        The course initally started in 2011 though I took over from 2012 and ran the course from both an
        administrative and content delivery perspective and managed stakeholder interest as <b>Head of Academy</b>.
        After my departure in 2015 the academy unfortunately wrapped up, though I have kept in contact
        with students and it has been exciting to watch their jounrey into the video games industry!
      </p>



      <h3 class="left">Operating the Academy</h3>

      <h4 class="left">Student Outcomes </h4>



      <h4 class="left">Creation of Curriculum</h4>
      <p>
        Initially, the curriculum for the course had been constructed from a handful of discrete units in order to just
        begin. Whilst these
        units gave some academic/theoretical grounding in game design, they weren't suited for either the timeframe of
        the
        course nor
        the desired practical, hands-on skills that employers generally seek in graduate developers - this coming from
        direct experience both hiring and applying!

        From this, the curriculum had a rewrite that would focus on a careful introduction of topics that considered
        any foundational and technical prerequisites along with a sober outlook as to just how far, in general, students
        could go with a particular subject over the course of 18 months. The units were designed to be complimentary and
        therefore were logically placed over the trimesters.

        The curriculum was also designed in a way that individual units, or logical groups, could be delivered
        independtly as short-courses. This modularity would help keep the Gaming Academy flexible and relevant whilst
        opening up other revenue streams using the same content.
      </p>


      <h4 class="left">Outreach</h4>
      <p>
        - Creating awareness for the Gaming Academy
        - Visits to local Universities, discussing game development as a career and the oppotunities in the UAE
        - Marketing efforts through Youtube, radio and magazines.

      <p> The students developed a game that was <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/352160/">successfully
          released on Steam</a>, the biggest digital games distribution platforms and has enjoyed more than 70'000
        downloads. This was the students final project where everyone worked together for 4 months creating a fun and
        fast paced
        hack 'n slash title. I
        assissted in the production aspects of the project and practiced common industry methods for development
        transforming the classroom environment into a production studio simulation.</p>
