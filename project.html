        <h3>Curse of Mermos - Student Project</h3>
        <p>
          I acted as instructor and technical director/artist (particles, lighting, animiation, shaders, performance).
          Result of 4 months creating a fun and fast paced hack 'n slash title. As the instructor of the course I
          assissted in the production aspects of the project and practiced common industry methods for development
          making the classroom environment an indy studio simulation. <a

      <h3 class="left">Rendering Behind Walls</h3>
      <p class="left"> One of the simplest solutins would be to add a second pass to shaders that one wants seen behind
        a wall. The
        issue with deferred though is that the z-pass is already established before final shading so there wasn't a way
        to cleanly render hidden objects without dozens of pixel-sized errors. Instead a 2nd camera running forward was
        used that matched the primary camera's perspective setup which ran a replacement shader. One the replacements
        would render select (via shader choice in material) geometry only into the depth buffer (ZWrite On, ColorMask
        0). This would prime the second <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShaderReplacement.html">replacement
          shader</a> used on characters to
        use a ZGreater check in order to render. The replacement camera only cleared depth and rendered after the
        deferred passes.

      <h3 class="left">Probe-O-Matic</h3>
      <p class="left">From the link: "<a class="lnk"
          href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/probe-o-matic-137538">Probe-O-Matic</a> is an
        automated Light Probe placement tool to speed up your workflow when it comes
        to ambient lighting for dynamic objects. Probe-O-Matic offers fast and robust probe placement through a variety
        of options such as Seeds, Volumes or NavMesh. This tool emerged from our real production need to semi-automate
        and control how and where light probes are placed in large scenes. Out of the box, Unity currently does not
        provide an easy way to do this which inspired us to write Editor tools to assist in this task."</p>

      </div>



      <h3 class="left">Attack System for Animated Characters</h3>
      <p class="left">This system was written from the gound up to support fast setup and configuration of
        attacks for an action game. I wanted the attacks to have careful setup and deliver results similar to what you
        would see in a Dark Souls game. The attack can control when 'damage sphers' are activated to fine tune this to
        the animation frames, as well as agent freezing and parrying windows. I wrote an editor to allow scrubbing of
        the animation to fine tune elements of the attack.</p>

      <h3 class="left">'Eventor' - Event scheduling tool for Unity</h3>
      <p class="left">Eventor is a custom made tool allowing designers to schedule numerous events such as spawnign an
        object, playing an animation by visualizing the sequence in a cut-scene style editor. The system works by
        running Jobs which derive from an abstract class. This allows very easy extentions where someone only need
        implement a co-routine of how they would like a custom job to operate.</p>

      <h3 class="left">Per-Vertex Radiosity Baking</h3>
      <p class="left">Below are some screen captures of a per-vertex radiosity baking script I wrote as an Editor Script
        inside of Unity. By capturing images from the point of view of each vertex and summing the colours it gave a
        very
        natural result to the lighting. This was also an excercise to explore the flexibility of the Unity Editor.</p>

        <h3>Reality Engine</h3>
        <p>Reality Engine was a middleware solution for quick prototyping. During my time at U235 Studios we licensed
          the engine but found many shortcomings in it's rendering and tools. After U235 I kept exploring the source
          code and made many tool, rendering and shading modifications (C++, C#, HLSL, .NET).

      <h3 class="left">Ubisoft test 2009</h3>
      <p class="left">Small forest scene as part of a test process for Ubisoft in 2009. The scene was very small & stuck
        to stringent material/texture/polycount budgets. In addition to the art (meshes, materials, fx, lighting) I also
        wrote all shaders required (such as scrolling 'god rays') and even implemeted lightmap support into the mesh
        serializer (Reality Engine) so that I could bake in a lot of the subtle ambient light.
      </p>
      <div id="r7">
        <script>image("ss/re/UbiTest01.jpg", "r7", "One of the final shots")</script>

      </div>



      <h3 class="left">Dynamic Shadow Mapping</h3>
      <p class="left">The enigne initially had basic shadow mapping that wasn't very satisfying. I took it upon myself
        to explore and improve this. I implemented a 3 stage LOD for the shadows - resolution would drop and at farther
        distances the depth buffer wouldn't update. Shaders would use less sampling (8x, 4x, unfiltered) which for the
        time (2007-2009) really helped performance. Visually the shadows were improved by using them as masks for lights
        (more natural) instead of Reality Engine's approach of multiply blend into the scene. Alpha tested materials
        were respected in the shadow rendering stage and normalmaps and parallax maps would bias the sampling which
        greatly improved the final look.
      </p>
      <div id="r8">
        <script>image("ss/re/newshadows01.jpg", "r8")</script>

        <script>image("ss/re/newshadows06.jpg", "r9", "Shadowmap offset by surface normalmaps")</script>
      </div>


      <h3 class="left">Per-Instance Ambient Occlusion</h3>
      <p class="left">A baking tool written for Reality Engine. The engine previously had no baking options so I
        implemented a standard AO baking routine for static scene meshes. Though, as this information was stored at the
        vertex level, this could be written to instances (folige, grass). As a work-a-round, I modified the engine batch
        renderer (c++) and the instancing shader to allow an instance to have a single float AO term passed along with
        other instnacing data. Therefore the bake tool could bake information for instances by assuming each instance as
        a point. Whilst not entirely accurate, it was very fast to bake, added little shader over-head (1 more float)
        and gave convincing results.
